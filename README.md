This is a dumb little proxy I made which provides an oEmbed endpoint which adds an API key on to the request and then proxies it to [iframely](https://iframely.com/). That's all it does right now. One day it might do more. I made it to use with [Synapse](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/) because I was tired of not having URL previews for Instagram links.

This is probably not terribly useful to you. This is mostly on GitHub so I can put dependabot to work on it.
